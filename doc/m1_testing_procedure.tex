\section{Preparing the board}
\subsection{Flashing}
Prior to running the test program, the board should be flashed. At least the Milkymist SoC bitstream and the BIOS must be present, but, as part of the normal production process, other data is typically present in the flash memory as well.

Flashing instructions are available at \url{http://www.milkymist.org/wiki/index.php?title=Flashing_the_Milkymist_One}.

\subsection{Set-up}
For successfully running all the tests, the following hardware set-up is needed:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A 3.3V serial cable must be connected to the serial header of the board. This cable is used to transfer the automated testing program to the board and to control it.
\item The board must be connected to a VGA monitor with DDC (EDID) support.
\item A memory card must be installed in the reader of the board. The memory card must contain a conventional bootsector (i.e. that ends with \verb!0x55AA!).
\item An audio source must be available to feed the line input of the board.
\item An audio amplifier must be connected to the line output of the board.
\item The board must be on an Ethernet network with a computer responding to the IP address \verb!192.168.0.14!.
\item A video source must be connected to the board's video input connector. (TODO)
\item The MIDI ports must be connected together (loopback) with a standard MIDI cable, preferably of the maximum length specified by the standard (15m).
\item The DMX ports must be connected together (loopback). (TODO)
\item A RC5 remote control must be available to trigger the infrared sensor.
\item Full speed and low speed USB devices must be available to test the host controller. (TODO)
\end{enumerate}

\section{Compiling the automated testing program}
This section can be skipped if a pre-compiled testing program is available.
\subsection{Installing clang}
Clang (LLVM) is needed to compile some tools used in the Milkymist SDK. It is a standard package available in most Linux distributions.
\subsection{Installing the LM32 toolchain}
LM32 toolchain binaries can be downloaded from \url{http://www.milkymist.org/mmsoc.html}. Debian packages are also available, and can be installed by adding the following line to /etc/apt/sources.list:
\begin{verbatim}
deb http://www.milkymist.org/debian/ ./
\end{verbatim}
Then, the LM32 toolchain can be installed with \verb!apt-get install gcc-lm32!.

It is also possible to compile a GCC 4.5+ toolchain by following the usual procedure and configuring the toolchain as \verb!lm32-elf! without built-in C library.

\subsection{Building the Milkymist SDK}
First, you need to obtain a copy of the Milkymist SoC source distribution and unpack it. It can be downloaded from \url{http://www.milkymist.org/mmsoc.html}.

Then, cd to the uncompressed folder and enter:
\begin{verbatim}
export MMDIR=`pwd`
./build_sdk.sh
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Building the testing program}
With the \verb!MMDIR! environment variable still set, go to the src folder of the source distribution of the testing program and enter \verb!make!. This will build the file boot.bin to be loaded into the board.

\section{Loading the automated testing program}
The tool \verb!flterm! is used. If you have built the Milkymist SDK, a copy is available as \$MMDIR/tools/flterm. It can also be installed in Debian (with the Milkymist repository configured) with:
\begin{verbatim}
apt-get install flterm
\end{verbatim}

Once \verb!flterm! is installed, loading the testing program is done with: (assuming \verb!/dev/ttyUSB0! is the device name of your serial cable)
\begin{verbatim}
flterm --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --kernel boot.bin
\end{verbatim}

The board will automatically download and run the program from \verb!flterm! during its boot sequence after a power-up or reset.

\section{Description of the tests}
\subsection{SDRAM}
\subsubsection{Random pattern}
This test fills a memory buffer with pseudo-random data, reads it back and check that the data was not changed.

\subsubsection{Hammer pattern}
The principle is the same as the previous test, but the written pattern is alternatively \verb!0x00000000! and \verb!0xffffffff!. This is meant to electrically stress the SDRAM interface by inducing a large number of simultaneously switching outputs (SSOs).

\subsubsection{Crosstalk pattern}
The pattern used is alternatively \verb!0xaaaaaaaa! and \verb!0x55555555!. This electrically stresses the SDRAM interface to test the absence of crosstalk issues.

\subsection{GPIO}
\subsubsection{Switch tests}
The switch tests wait for each pushbutton to be pressed and released. If a pushbutton does not respond, the command \verb!f! can be typed to mark the test as failed. If the pushbutton test is not desired, it can be skipped with the command \verb!s!.

\subsubsection{LED tests}
The LED tests light each LED in turn and asks if it was correctly lit. The tests can be skipped by typing \verb!s!.

\subsection{VGA}
\subsubsection{DDC}
The test attempts to read the EDID of the connected monitor and checks if its header is correct. The correct EDID header is:
\begin{verbatim}
00 FF FF FF FF FF FF 00
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Test card}
The test displays a test card on the monitor (figure~\ref{testcard}) and asks if it is correctly rendered.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{testcard.eps}
\caption{VGA test card.} \label{testcard}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Memory card}
\subsubsection{Card initialization}
The test performs the initialization of the memory card and checks that the card answers correctly. It basically checks the clocking and command lines of the memory card.

\subsubsection{Block read}
The test reads the first block of the card (block 0) and checks that it ends with \verb!0x55AA! (as a regular bootsector does). It exercises all the signals between the memory card and the FPGA.

\subsection{Audio}
\subsubsection{Codec probe}
The test checks for the presence of the LM4550 identification number in the AC97 identification register.

\subsubsection{Line and headphones output}
The test plays a 400Hz sine wave tone for one second and asks if it was correctly rendered. The command \verb!s! can be used to skip the test and the command \verb!r! to play the tone again.

\subsubsection{Microphone}
Approximately one second of audio is recorded from the built-in microphone, then played back. The test then asks if the sound was heard back. The command \verb!s! can be used to skip the test and the command \verb!r! to start over.

\subsubsection{Line input}
This is the same test as above, but with the line input.

\subsection{Ethernet}
\subsubsection{MDIO}
This checks if the KSZ8001 identification number can be read over the MDIO link.

\subsubsection{ARP resolution}
This test exercises packet transmission and reception by attempting an ARP resolution of the IP address \verb!192.168.0.14!. The board has the IP address \verb!192.168.0.42! for this test.

Any computer normally configured with the IP address \verb!192.168.0.14! should answer the ARP request coming from the board.

\subsection{Video input}
\subsubsection{Decoder probe}
TODO
\subsubsection{Capture}
TODO

\subsection{MIDI}
The test sends the 256 possible values of the bytes used in the MIDI protocol, and check that they are correctly received back. The MIDI input and output connectors of the board must be connected together for this test.

\subsection{DMX512}
TODO

\subsection{Infrared}
The test waits for a "power off" RC5 code to be received. The device identification bits of the RC5 codes are ignored, so most RC5 remote controls can be used to perform the test. If the IR sensor does not respond, the command \verb!f! can be typed to mark the test as failed. If the IR test is not desired, it can be skipped with the command \verb!s!.

\subsection{USB}
TODO
